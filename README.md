    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    When it comes to developing software off on user needs, we start by understanding the system they want that I mean exactly how the system is going to be made whether it is a website, app for desktop, or mobile. after this we start to understand the needs of our users and help to address the most important ones they want as well as how long each task may take to implement in that finding the one that is important and will also take the less amount of time can help with developing our software.
    
    With these things we hope to do for our user's needs it would be useful to develop some way of arranging and developing which tasks are the ones to focus based on the user needs as well offer which tasks may be the fastest to complete, with that we have a very powerful tool known as users stories that help to do just that and help to focus on specific subjects with our team and address them as we complete the previous ones.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    When developing a program there are a few different strategies whether those be a waterfall or an agile approach whenever we develop a program we will always use at least one of these strategies. When choosing between a waterfall or agile approach it is important to consider what we will need for our project to be done. if we choose an agile approach scrum may help us to achieve our user's needs in a timely manner while also allowing us to change things about our project as the user's needs may change as we have seen in this class.
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    To be a good team member we must be able to accept change as they come as well as constantly offer advice to our other team members and make it not seem like a personal attack on the other team members. Another thing that makes a good team member is to be able to fully support and offer to help other team members that may be struggling with their especially when it comes to changing from a waterfall approach to an agile approach.
