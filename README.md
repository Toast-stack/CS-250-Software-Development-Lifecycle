- The executable JAR file `BasicListViewControl.jar` can be used to run the application.

**How to Run:**
1. Navigate to the directory containing `BasicListViewControl.jar`.
2. Execute the JAR file by double-clicking it or running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   java -jar BasicListViewControl.jar

### Slide Show Project
**Objective:** Create a slideshow application that cycles through images or content, demonstrating proficiency in event handling and user interface design.
**Files:** All relevant materials are located in the  `Slide Show/` directory.
